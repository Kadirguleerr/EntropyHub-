\# EntropyHub



EntropyHub is a hybrid entropy generation framework that combines hyperchaotic dynamical systems with a Rust-optimized computational core and a post-quantum cryptographic integration layer.



\## Project Motivation



In this project, we aimed to move beyond traditional linear PRNG approaches by leveraging nonlinear chaotic dynamics. The goal was to explore a more complex and future-proof entropy generation model, especially considering the emerging impact of quantum computing on modern cryptographic systems.



\## Architecture Overview



\- Hyperchaotic differential system-based entropy generation

\- Rust-optimized core for performance-critical computations

\- Python orchestration and visualization layer

\- Size-compatible Kyber-768 (ML-KEM-768) post-quantum integration



\## Post-Quantum Readiness



The project includes a structural Kyber-768 compatible layer aligned with NIST FIPS 203 parameter sizes. This demonstrates architectural readiness for post-quantum cryptographic integration.
